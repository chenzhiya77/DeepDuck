"""Run-level harness constitution: publish/query registry + record builder.

Spec: ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-harness-constitution-snapshot-design.md``

Pure data + one process-wide registry. Deliberately **no LangGraph import and no
``app.*`` import** (``tests/test_harness_boundary.py`` enforces the latter): the
registry must work with whatever object the factory returns, so it stores an
``Any`` and never inspects a graph. The only framework import is
``AgentMiddleware``, needed to tell an overridden hook from the base no-op.

Two halves:

* :func:`build_constitution_record` — a pure function over the facts the agent
  factory already computed. No I/O, no framework calls.
* :func:`publish_constitution` / :func:`constitution_for` — a
  ``WeakKeyDictionary`` keyed by the compiled graph, so a per-run graph is
  reclaimed automatically once the worker drops it.
