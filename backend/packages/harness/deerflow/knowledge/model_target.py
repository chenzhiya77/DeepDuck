"""RAG model-target resolution and its missing-fields verdict (spec 2026-09-23 default model D3/D10.1).

Every RAG role has its own declaration in the ``rag:`` block (``extract_model`` /
``judge_model`` / ``vlm_model``) and one RAG-wide default sits behind them. A caller picks
its own role declaration first and passes it in as ``name``; this module answers the half
they all share — the RAG default, else the first configured model — and, for a target the
user explicitly declared, whether that target is usable at all.

Deliberately pure and standalone: no SDK construction, no network, no Qdrant, and no read
of the global config singleton unless the caller hands one over. The RAG save path passes
``rag=`` the *pending* block it is about to write, because ``config.rag`` still carries the
file being replaced and would answer for the wrong configuration.

Name lookup is exact: an explicit role name is never replaced by a default (a typo must
reach the factory and raise), and only the RAG default itself may be superseded — with a
warning that names it. A missing model list is not resolved here; the caller reports it.
