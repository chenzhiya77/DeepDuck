"""Knowledge-base access gate + runtime scope resolution (spec §4.5, §7).

Phase-1 permission model is owner-only: a KB is reachable exactly when the
caller is its owner (``visibility``/invite-based sharing arrives in Phase 2 —
the check funnels through this one function so the upgrade touches one place).
The scope resolver pulls the bound ``kb_id`` and the effective ``user_id``
from the tool runtime context, per the single-KB binding chain: frontend →
run ``context.kb_id`` → mandatory Qdrant filter.
