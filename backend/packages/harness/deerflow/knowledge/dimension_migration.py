"""Move the vector library to another width (spec 2026-09-26 D1 乙 / D5-2, D5-6).

The width is part of the identity of a vector space, so changing it is a rebuild, not an
edit: every stored vector belongs to the old space. This module runs the *ordered* half of
that rebuild — build the new generation, re-embed every library into it, re-embed whatever
the switch window added, and report. It deliberately stops there: **the switch itself
(writing the new width) and dropping the old generation belong to the caller**, which is
the only layer that knows the configuration file (D5-7).

Three properties are the point, and each is a test:

- **Build before you switch.** The new generation is created empty, the old one keeps
  answering every read until the caller flips, so a failure here leaves the running
  deployment untouched — the failure mode is "nothing happened", not "half a library".
- **A leftover is not resumed, it is dropped.** An interrupted run leaves a half-filled
  new generation; the next run drops it and starts over (D5-2). Resuming would have to
  reason about which points are stale, which is exactly the state nobody can audit.
- **The switch window is covered** (D5-6): anything that arrived or changed during the run
  is re-embedded before the caller flips — measured by the library's own content
  signature, and including documents still moving through the worker, whose writes land
  in the old generation until the flip.
