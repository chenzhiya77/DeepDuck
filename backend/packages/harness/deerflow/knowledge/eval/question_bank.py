"""Per-KB golden question bank file operations (spec 2026-08-27 §4.1/§4.2).

The question bank is runtime data — one JSONL per knowledge base at
``{data_dir}/knowledge/{kb_id}/golden.jsonl`` (the same directory tree the
documents live under) — not a git fixture. Two error classes are deliberately
distinct because the API maps them differently:

- ``QuestionBankInvalidQuestion``: the *new* input violates the golden schema
  → caller-visible 422, the client fixes the payload;
- ``QuestionBankCorrupted``: the *existing* file fails ``load_golden``
  (hand-edited dirty line) → 500 naming the offending line; dirty questions
  silently pollute every metric built on them, so this never gets skipped.

Schema validation is delegated to ``dataset.validate_question`` — UI writes
and CLI loads share one guard. Writes go through read-modify-write of the
whole file (50–100 questions scale) with a tmp sibling + ``os.replace``, so a
crash mid-write can never leave a half-written bank behind; a per-path
``asyncio.Lock`` serializes concurrent mutations within the process.
