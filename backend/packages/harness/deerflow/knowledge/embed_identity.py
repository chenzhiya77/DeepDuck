"""The embedding identity: which coordinate space a library's vectors live in (spec 2026-10-04 D2).

The identity covers exactly the three fields that decide the space — provider, model and
base_url. The API key is deliberately absent: rotating a credential changes no vector.
The width is absent too: it is its own axis and has its own channel (``rag_migration``).

The value is a compact JSON object rather than a bare hash so the mismatch warning (D4)
can name *which* field moved; a hash could only ever answer "different".

Written at exactly two points, both of which know the vectors are uniform:
``reindex_kb`` after a fully successful rebuild, and the indexing worker when a
library's first document completes. An incomplete rebuild or a later incremental
document never writes — a library whose space is unknown or mixed keeps ``NULL``
rather than a false claim (``NULL`` = unstamped, not "current").
