"""Build the configured embedder — dense provider, sparse route, and their wiring (spec §4.2).

Four things are decided here, and they are the reason this is a module rather than a call
to one class:

1. **Who embeds.** ``rag.embedding_provider`` resolves through the curated allowlist (same
   rule as the rerank and parse legs: a caller never supplies a class path).
2. **Who supplies the sparse half.** ``rag.embedding_sparse_source`` picks the provider
   itself, a separate sparse service, or local BM25. When it is not the provider, 甲's
   composition adapter holds both halves and still returns one ``EmbeddingResult`` per text,
   so no caller changes.
3. **Which dimension we are in.** The Qdrant collections are created at 1024 and are not
   recreated on a dimension change (§4.2 维度 #2), so the width must be certified. A provider
   that pins the dimension in its request (DashScope) needs nothing; any other provider is
   measured once per process — reused from the first real embedding, so the certification
   costs no extra round trip — and a non-1024 width is refused with a pointer at the rebuild
   entry, which is the documented way out (§4.2 维度 #4).
4. **Whether the sparse half actually arrived.** ``sparse_source=provider`` trusts the
   allowlist and the model-level probe, but a probe cannot cover every call, so the same
   build wraps the result in a check that refuses an empty sparse vector (D5).

    An empty sparse vector is a *legitimate value* — letting it through once means it is
    really stored, and a "judged already" cache would skip the check on every later call,
    i.e. shout once and stay silent forever, which is worse than the silence we started
