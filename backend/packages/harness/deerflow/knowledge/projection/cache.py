"""In-process projection cache keyed by a cheap content fingerprint (spec §6 P3).

The fingerprint is recomputed on every request — a cheap DB digest over
per-table count + max-timestamp signals — and decides everything: a matching
fingerprint serves the stored entry without recomputing; any difference (or
``refresh=True``) recomputes and replaces. Concurrent misses for the same key
collapse into a single fetch+reduce behind a per-key lock, so a KB being
viewed by many clients at once never triggers a thundering herd of SVDs.

No persistence on purpose (spec §6 权衡): a cold restart simply recomputes on
first view — seconds for a 10k-point KB — and no new migration is needed.
