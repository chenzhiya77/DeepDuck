"""Incremental global entity re-resolution (spec 2026-08-10 D3).

Per-slice normalization only merges aliases inside one chunk's extraction —
the same real-world entity written differently across slices (``Model`` /
``Models``) survives as two graph nodes. After a document's graph leg, the
worker runs this resolver over the touched entities (+ their 1-hop
neighbours; the whole table below ``full_scan_threshold``) and merges the
alias groups found by ``cluster_alias_groups`` (surface fold + embedding
cosine ≥ threshold, the same two mechanisms as the per-slice normalizer).

Side-effect chain per group, all idempotent (Qdrant has no transactions —
idempotency is the recovery story):

1. ``graph_entities``: representative absorbs descriptions (fragment-deduped)
   and ``source_chunk_ids``; alias rows deleted.
2. ``graph_relations``: endpoints rewritten to the representative, duplicate
   triples merged, merge-created self-loops dropped.
3. ``kb_entities``: alias vectors deleted; the representative is re-embedded
   from its merged description.
4. Chunk entity tags dual-written: business-DB ``chunks.entities`` column and
   the ``kb_chunks`` payload — the two mirrors must move together.
5. Wiki lifecycle (spec §3.5 条目生命周期): entries titled by a merged-away
   alias are deleted outright — business row + ``kb_wiki_entries`` vector
   point — since the entity is gone and the title has nothing left to
   regenerate from; the representative's entry is marked ``dirty`` and the
   existing incremental refresh chain regenerates it from the merged
   material.

Failure handling lives in the worker: a failing resolution never blocks the
pipeline — the document still reaches ``ready`` and gains a visible
``entity-resolution failed`` error sub-marker.
