"""Admin RAG functional-model configuration API (spec 2026-09-10 rag functional-model config §4).

``GET`` reports the *effective* configuration the ingestion pipeline will use — merged
from ``config.yaml`` and the API-writable ``rag_config.json`` — with every secret masked
and each field's origin declared, so the settings UI can show what is in force and where
it comes from. ``PUT`` replaces the whole API-writable object and writes **only**
``rag_config.json``; ``config.yaml`` stays the operator-trusted source and is never
written through the Gateway.

Secrets: a read never returns a stored key (it returns the masking sentinel), and a write
that submits the sentinel keeps the stored value. Omitting a field *removes* it from the
file, which is how an admin reverts a field to ``config.yaml`` (or to the environment,
for a key) — the submitted object is the new file content, not a patch.

#
# D7 asks one question about a *service* before anything is saved: will this endpoint give
# us segment-level timestamps we can project onto shot cards? Two things make the answer
# non-trivial: the API only segments when the speaker flag is on (so "no segments" is a real
# outcome), and a backend that only received text can synthesise segments by pro-rating the
# duration over character counts (§5.2). Hence a fixture with a known pause and two
# independent criteria.

#: The probe fixture: a synthesised 8.965 s clip — sentence A read fast, a 1.2 s pause, then
#: sentence B read slowly (Task 0, 2026-09-29). It must stay **tracked by git**: hatchling
#: and the Docker build both take what git has, so an ignored asset would ship missing.
ASR_PROBE_FIXTURE_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / "assets" / "asr_probe.wav"

#: The fixture's known pause, and how far a boundary may sit outside it. The pause is 1.9 s
#: wide, so this tolerance is generous for any real segmenter and still rejects a boundary
#: derived from character counts (which lands near 3.59 s).
ASR_PROBE_PAUSE_MS = (1320, 3220)
ASR_PROBE_PAUSE_TOLERANCE_MS = 150

#: How far apart the segments' ms-per-character figures must be. Real segmentation puts
#: sentence A (fast) and B (slow) about 2x apart; pro-rating over character counts makes
#: them exactly equal by construction, whatever the split points.
