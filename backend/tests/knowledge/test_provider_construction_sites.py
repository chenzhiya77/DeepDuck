"""Guard: provider implementations are built by their factory, never constructed directly.

Spec 2026-09-14: each leg of the provider dimension has exactly one construction point, so
the object a call site gets is always the one the configuration describes.

- **rerank** (§4.1 / P1): the search paths and the recall test must build the *same*
  reranker — an evaluation that grades a different retriever than the one serving queries
  is not an evaluation. The failure is silent, too: the wrong provider usually raises, and
  ``RerankerError`` degrades to the embedding-cosine order, so nothing surfaces.
- **embedding** (§4.2 / P3): the same rule, with a wider blast radius — a direct
  construction would ignore the configured provider *and* the sparse route, so a document
  indexed through it lands in a different vector space than the query side.
- **parse** (§4.4 / P2): one resolution point, ``parse_document``.

Scope, the other way: this covers *construction by class name*. An aliased import
(``DashScopeReranker as DS``), a ``getattr`` lookup, or a subclass would slip past — the
guard's job is to block the shape a regression actually takes (copying the line above it),
not to be a proof.
